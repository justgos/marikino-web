          Hi! My name is Mari Kinovych, and I am an illustrator.<br/>
          I live and work in Kyiv, Ukraine.<br/>
          <br/>
          This is my second attempt to become a proper freelancer. Before this I worked as an illustrator in motion design studio, where I loved to draw in vector and found out how to work with animation at all.<br/>
          <br/>
          I love my job and consider myself a happy person, though it doesn't mean that I am not frustrated sometimes. I like this kind of freedom, when you can be different with every new illustration, but also I love some boring technical tasks where you don't need to be creative.<br/>
          <br/>
          I work with different clients and tasks. My favorites are illustrations for some editorial/social media purposes and books. My commercial projects are on <a href="https://www.behance.net/marikino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">behance</a>.<br/>
          <br/>
          Besides work I have a lot fun with my dog, like to cook (but not everyday), do yoga, plant my balcony with succulents and find pleasure in watching paintings of Old Masters. I spend too much time in social media and want to practice more analogue graphics, but not today &gt;&lt;<br/>
          <br/>
          Hope you are enjoying my illustration space!<br/>
          <br/>
